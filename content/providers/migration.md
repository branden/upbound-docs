Upbound maintains migration tooling to support customers migrating from either community providers or the monolithic Official Providers to the new family provider architecture.

The tooling also supports upgrading from one version of an Official Provider to a newer version when there are breaking API changes in the new version.

## Migrating from community to Official Providers

Documentation coming soon.

## Migrating from monolithic to family Official Providers

For manual migration to the family Official Providers refer to the [migration guide]({{<ref "/knowledge-base/migrate-to-provider-families">}}).

Documentation for the automated tooling coming soon.

## Upgrading to a Official Provider version with breaking API changes

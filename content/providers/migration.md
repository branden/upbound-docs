Upbound maintains migration tooling to support customers migrating from either
community providers or the monolithic Official Providers to the new family
provider architecture.

The tooling further supports the upgrading from one version of an Official
Provider to another when there are breaking API changes.

## Migrating from community to Official Providers

Documentation coming soon.

## Migrating from monolithic to family Official Providers

For manual migration to the family Official Providers refer to the
[migration guide]({{<ref "/knowledge-base/migrate-to-provider-families">}}).

Documentation for the automated tooling coming soon.

## Upgrading to a Official Provider version with breaking API changes

Documentation coming soon.
